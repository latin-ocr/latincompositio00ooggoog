424. lt should be carefully noted that the various constructione
of the dative with verbs all corne under the general head of the
indirect object. Many intransitive verbs take an indirect object
and are therefore followed by the dative. Transitive verbs take
a direct object and are followed by the, accusative, but sometimes
they have an indirect object or dative as well. The whole question,
then, as to whether or not a certain verb takes tlte dative depende
upon its capacity for governing an indirect object. Remember
that English is not a safe gulde, for many verbs that are transitive
in English are intransitive in Latin, and vice versa.
