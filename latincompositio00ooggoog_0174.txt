22 LATIN COMPOSITION-PART ΙΙ

c. Qualities that lack permanence are expressed by the ablativr
This applies especially to the description oi passing emotions ani
ieelings ι -

'Bono animo est, Ire is os good couragc.

d. Permanent and essential quaiities may be expressed by eithe
ὼε genitive or the ablative : -
Cato singulari prudentia (or singularis prudentiae) erat, Cat
was os remarkable sagacity.

Finally‚ it should be noted that neither the genitive nor th
ablative may stand without an attributive adjective oi degree lik
magnus, parvus, summus, etc.

73. The partitive genitive denotes the whole oi which a part is
taken. Hence it is obvious that ii not merely a part but the whole
is taken there can be no partitive genitive. While then we say
magna pars horum, a great part of these, using the partitive geni-
tive‚ we cannotsayomnes horum tor Ant os thesabutratheromneslr'u

⁷4. lt is important to remember that the partitive genitiveis
not usual aiter cardinal numerals or quidam, but ffiat ex or de with
the ablative is used instead.
