iv PREFACE

Itis the general experience of teachers that young pupils
fail to understand much that the grammar contains, and that
they also fail to discriminate between the important and un·
important. Considerable matter of an explanatory character
' has therefore been added to the grammatical references,
This acts as a medium between the student and the grammar :
interprets what is obscure or technical in statement, throws
into strong relief what is essential and of vital importance‚
and presents in brief summaries, practical and convenient
for memorizing, the most important constructions

The exercises for oral translation are very simple and have
been made so easy as not to demand a large amount of time
in preparation. They can be used most easily and profit-
ably in connection with each day's review lesson. Each
fourth exercise is in connected narrative prose and designed
for written translation. The written exercises are without
new grammar work, and aim to review especially the syntac-
tical principles treated in the three preceding oral exercises
and to give practice in* writing connected Latin. In both
ora] and written exercises the most space has been given to
the constructions that are the most important. A few les·
sons involving some of the more difficult or more unusual
constructions have been marked with an asterisk and may
be omitted at the discretion of the teacher. Reviews of
both idioms and grammar are provided for at convenient
intervals.

Schools differ so greatly in the amount of time given to
Latin composition that it is impossible to make a manual of a
siae that will suit all conditions. Many schools will find it pos·
sible to finish all of Part Ι. For such as do not take it all, it

would be well to go at least as far as “The Syntax of N ouns‚’'
Lesson LXXXVII. This subject is taken up more fully in
Part II and may be deferred until that time.
