325. The tenses of the participles are used with much greater
precision in Latin than in English. For example, in the sentences-

a‘. The captives weeping beggedsor peace.
b. Ceasar hearing tln's was much disturbet.

the English participles weeping and henriq are both present. ,
The Latin would use the present participle in a, but the perfect
in b; because in a the action of the participle and of the verb are
contemporaneous, but in b the action of the participle is prior to·
that of the verb, hence :-

α. captiviflentds picem petebant
b. His anantes caesar perturbabitur.

ln short, do not use the present participle in Latin unless the
act denoted by it is contemporaneous with that of the verb on
which the participle depends.

326. Observe that the Latin participle lacks the present pas-
sive (eg. being seen) and the perfect active (eg. leaving seen).

a. The present passive participle is supplied by a clause with
dum orcum.

b. The perfect active participle is supplied-

1. ln deponent verbs by the perfect passive participle with
active meaning: Ceasar, having set out— caesar profectus.

2. ln other verbs by a clause with cum or postquam or by the
perfect passive participle in the ablative absolute : —-
