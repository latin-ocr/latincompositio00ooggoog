301. When the Veneti had been informed that men-ot·
war were being built on the Loire, which ¹ll0ws into the
ocean, and that Caesar ²was coming as soon as 8the time ot
“ year would permit, they determined to prepare ior the war Ι
which ⁴was impending. They perceived the magnitude ot
the danger and how great a crime they had committed 5ἰῐι
that they had thrown the ambassadors into chains 3 butnever-
theless they were confident that the Romans, who were not
acquainted with the places⁸ where they were going to carry
on war, could not remain with them long. For they knew
the shallows, the harbors and islands‚ and had very many
ships ; and navigation is a very different thing in an inclosed
sea and on the mighty ocean.
