41. ln the agreement of the relative pronoun it is important to
. observe that, while the pronoun agrees-with its antecedent in gen·
der and in number, its case is determinedhy its function in the
relative clause which it serves to introduce. Note the following ’
examples :-
Caesar milltes qni timidi erant non landibat.
Coesar did not praisc the soldicrs who were asraicl.

Here hui agrees with milites in gender and in number, but while
militie is accusative qui is nominative as subject ot erant.

uilitas quie vidimus sunt timidi.

T hc soldiers whom wc sec arc asrachl

Here militis is nominative and quie is accusative.
Princeps cuius filins est captus paoem petebat.
T he chief whose son was captured was suing sor peace.

'Hereprlnoopa is nominative and citius is genitive. Therefore, when·
ever the relative and its antecedent are in the same case, it is a mere
coincidence and not at all due to grammatical agreement.

42. A relative agrees with a predicate noun in its ownclause
rather than with an antecedent of different gender and number.

stream.
