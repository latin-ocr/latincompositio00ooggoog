261. It is oi the tirst importance to remember that the tense oi
the infinitive in indirect discourse is determined by the tense ol
the verb which it represents in direct discourse. Its tense has
nothing to do with the tense of the verb oi saying on which the
indirect discourse depends, and is not affected by the laws oi
tense-sequence. For example, ii we have in direct discourse the
sentence- ⁵

milites fortiter prignant,
the verb prignant, being present in tense, will be represented in
indirect discourse by the present infinitive, no matter what tlte
tense may be of tlte verb that introduces the indirect discourse .· -
