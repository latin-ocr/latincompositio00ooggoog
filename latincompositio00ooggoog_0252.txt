³23. We can not hide this (fact), that all the best men,
even the very philosophers who write pamphlets on the
1worthlessness of fame, are influenced by the desire for '
praise. Many of our generals almost with arms in their
hands have sought to perpetuate² the memory of their names
by monuments and statues. Surely, if the mind did not
look forward to the future aud if we thought that all things
would perish with ourselves, we should not torture ourselves
with such anxieties aud labors up to the last moment ⁸of our
lives. ⁴Slnce then we are all so desirous⁶ of immortality‚
we ought to preserve this poet who promises that he will
spread abroad to the everlasting memory of the world the
glorious exploits of the Roman people.

1. Latin, ‘⁸ the despising of glory.” 2. prodero. 3. Latin, ‘⁴ of lifess'
4. Latin, “ on which account since.'' 5. cupidus, a. -rm
