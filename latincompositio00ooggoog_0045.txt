104. On the next day Caesar, changing his lineos march,
hastened to go to Bibracte, which was the richest city oi the
Haedui and not more than eighteen miles distant, because
in two days1 it ²would be necessary to measure out grain to
tle army. ‘The Helvetii thought that he was frightened‚
tud began to follow and harass ours on the rear. But
Cesar led his forces to the nearest. hill, and, ‘drawing up
lis line of battle, said: “Gather the packs into one place,
and let the two legions which Ι last enrolled be stationed
t on the top of yonder⁴ ridge.''

106. The Setiuence of Tenses is nothing peculiar to Latin, but ¹
isiamiliar from English usage. Compare-

He fears that he may die.
He faared that be might die.

The change from may to might, owing to the change in the main
verb from saara to sacred, corresponds to the change in Latin from
the present to the imperfect subjunctive. The above in Latin

,ΜΗ ¹³⁸* rimetur moriatur.
Timebat ne moreretur.

The laws oi Teme-sequence do not apply with equal stringency
to all dependent constructions and were often disregarded.
