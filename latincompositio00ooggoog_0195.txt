155. The citizens knew that Catiline deserved death, and
wished to lay violent hands on him. There were many, tou,
who felt that they were in great peril because they and Cati-
line were encompassed by the same city walls. 1Knowing
this, Catiline, to avoid suspicion, wished to give himself into
custody and «even dared to go to the consul and ask that he
keep him at his own house. But Cicero ²refused to receive

ι him and tried to persuade him to go into exile 8by making
him perceive⁴ what the senators thought of him; ‘for Cati-
line ‘had previously said that he would lay the matter before
the senate and obey the authority oi that body.
