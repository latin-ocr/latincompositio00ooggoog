224. The enemy waited for a long time (to see) ii Caesar
would cross the swamp‚ but after he had led his troops back
into camp they hastened to the Axona ¹t0r the purpose of
destroying the bridge. Since, however, they could neither
take the city nor cross the river, 2it was discussed in a council
whether it was best to return home or to remain longer. We
know why 8the Bellovaci could not be persuaded to remeia,
and there was the added fact that provisions had begun to fail.

1. Latio, “with this purpose, that they might destroy.” 2. deliberi-
tumest. 3. Follow the text.

227. In dealing with conditions, the first thing to be determined Α

“ is the TIME. The English is often misleading‚ owing to the fact

that the tense used and the real time denoted by it are not always
the sarne (cf. sec. 71). Compare the two sentences :—

a. ll this is astate, Ι am a citizen.

b. ll the general arrives, he will conquer.
In a the tense used and the time are both present,· but in b the
present arrives is really future in time, as is shown by the verb
will conque? in the conclusion. It is to be observed-. ·

1. That Latin always translates the real trine oi the English
verb rather than the tense in which it may appear.
