75. The tenses of the subjunctive in independent clauses
denote time as follows :-

a. Present denotesfuture or tiodefim'te time.
Subjunctive b. Imperfect deuotes present or past time.
Tenses. c. Perlect denotessuture or past time.
d. PluperTect denotes past time.

lt will be seen that though the subjunctive has no iutrue tenses
the future idea is inherent in both the present and the perfect
tense. When the future idea is emphatic the first periphrastic
forms are used (eg. amitinus sim).

76. The Latin subjunctive in someoi its constructions approaches
the meaning of the English potential auxiliaries: moy, can, must,
might, could, would, should. But when these auxiliaries are* literal
and emphatic they must be rendered by independent verbS, as nray,

might, by licet; can, could, by possum should by debeo, etc.

⁷⁷. Many subjunctive constructions are translated by the Eng-
lish indicative and show no special lorm 0r modal auxiliary. ln
such cases, therefore, there is nothing in the English to show that
the Latin subjunctive must be used: e.g. scih quid facias, Ι know
what you are doing,· tanta erat tempestas ut nives dispellerentur,
tlte storm was so great that tlte shz'ps were scattered.

te. The subjunctive is used in independent sentences to
express-

1. An exhortation or command (Hortatory or Volitive). Nega·
tive is ηδ.
⁴ 2. Awish 0r desire (Optative). Negative is ne.
· 3. A rhetorical question expressing doubt or indignation (Delib
erative). N egative is non.
⁹ 4. Α possibility (Potential). Negative is nin.

⁷9. The ,Hortatory Subjunctive in its usual form isin the first
or third person ol the present tense, and is introduced in English
by lot. When expressing a command itis sometimes called the
jussive (cf. iuheb) subjunctive.
