LESSON III

10. Agreement oi Adiectivea. - Ref. 27.

11. When an attributive adjective is used with two or more
substantives, it agrees with the nearest, and may be placed before
- or after the first substantive or after the last: —

multi filii et filiae
Filii multi et filiae many sons and daughters.
Filii et filiae multae '

ξ But not before the last—2
Filii et multae filiae-

ior in that case multae would be understood as belonging to
⁸ filiae alone. .
