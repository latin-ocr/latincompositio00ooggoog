144. When a relative clause states not a mere fact about the
antecedent (cf. sec. 11⁸), but defines it as having a certain quality
or characteristic, the subjunctive is used and we have a relative
clause of characteristic. This construction is especially common
vhen the antecedent is indefinite or general and needs to be
defined Compare the two sentences-

a. The soldtitr who is fitting is asraral

h. Na ane who flers is brave.

ln a the relative clause merely states the iact that the soldier
isfleeing; in b the thoughtis “No one afsuch a character that
he fiees is brave.” Hence the Latin : —

a. Miles qui fugit eet timidus.

t. neme qurfiQeetforta.

145. Among the indefinite and general expressions followed by
the relative clause oi characteristic are the following : -

there are same} who Ξ ’unt qui
