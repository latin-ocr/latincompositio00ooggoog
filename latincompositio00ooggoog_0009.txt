· ¹ PREFACE

The purpose of the studyof Latin composition is gener-
ally conceded to be, not to teach the art of writing Latin as
an end in itself, but rather to increase the student’s famil-
< iarity with the style, idioms, and vocabulary of the authors
heis reading, and at the same time to afford effective instruc·
tion in syntax. It is for the accomplishment of this twofold
purpose that the following three years' course has been pre
pared. The course is divided into three parts, designed
respectively for the second, third, and fourth years of the
secondary school, and is of the following character :-

Part l is based on Caesar’s Gallie War for vocabulary,
idioms, and general content; but in syntax the exercises
are made to conform to the systematic presentation of the ’
subject which characterizes the lessons throughout. To
take up constructions in Latin composition in the capricious
order in which they happen to occur in the accompanying
text has been shown to be pedagogically unsound and fatally
weak in that the subjects are not presented in their proper
order or logical course of development, and the student is
unable to bring the disorganized bits of knowledge thus ac· ,
quired into a strong and well-organized synthetic whole. The
constructions have, therefore, been taken up in their grammat·
ical sequence, and the exercises are preceded by appropriate
grammar-lessons; next follow selected idioms to be memo
rized, and finally the sentences aim to give practical and illu-
minating expression to the syntax and idioms that precede.
