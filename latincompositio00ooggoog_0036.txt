¹11. Latin is much more exact than English in tlte use of tenses.
Attention has already been called to the common use ol the English
present ior what is really future (ci. sec. 66); in like manner Eng-
lish often uses a present or future lor what is really future perfect.
ln every instance the Latin will use the exact tense. Hence tho
future perfect is much commonet in Latin than in English.
