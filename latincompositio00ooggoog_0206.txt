189. The perfect indicative with antequam and priusquam is
especially common when the main clause is negative and the main
verb in the historical perfect: hostes non prius pugni excesserunt
quam duoem concidere moerentem enemy diderat ceasefram battle
before tbey saw their leaderfall.

states an actual occurrence; a· subjunctive, on the other hand,
shows that the event was assumed or purposed‚ but did not actually
take place at 311. The sentence above (sec. lua) is a good exam·
ple of the force of the indicative3 but compare the following:
ante pax est facta quam telum conmoritur, peace was made before
a weaporr was lbrawn. Here the implicationis that the weapon
was aab thrason, and the subjunctive is used. 1
