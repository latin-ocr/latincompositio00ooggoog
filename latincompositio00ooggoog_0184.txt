109. The Ablative oi trice, Rer. 183 himer, Ref. ⁹3 Qualltyor ἱ

characteristic, Rei. 1³ ς cause, Rei. ὗς with dignus and insignus, Rei. ⁸3
Speoiflcation, Rer. 16. See also Part 1 sec. 490.

110. ⁴ Distihguish careiully between the construction used atter 1
verbs and expressions oi estimation and value (aestima ficem, ἒ,
dicere, habire, etc.) and that used aiter verbs oi buying and sell· ”

ing. The iormer take the genitive, the latter the ablatioer— ·
Voluptitem virtirs minimi facit, virtue conniiors plcasure os Ι

the very least account.
Vitttria multo sanguine stetit, tlte victory cost much blood.

N.B. The only important exception to this rule is that the four
genitivos tanti, quanti, pltris, minoris, are used aiter verbs oi
buying and selling to express relative value.

111. English ¹coitoi is by no means always translatable by the
Ι Latin cum. cum is used only with the ablative oi acccompani·
ment and the ablative ol manner, and not always with thern (ct.
sec. 1⁰0 andria).

112. Note the four ways oi expressing manner: —

1. Celeriter currit (adverb). '
2. cum celeritite currit (ablative with cnm).
3. Summi celeritite currit (ablative with an adjective).

4. cum summi celeritite currit (ablative with an adjective and 1

cum).

11³. To express emphatic cause the Latin uses, instead oi the
bare ablative, the prepositions ob or propter with the accusative, ox,
di, or ab with the ablative; or causi or gritii with a preceding
genitive.
