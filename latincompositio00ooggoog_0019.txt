2. The words of an English sentence stand in a fixed order
which shows their grammatical relation to each other. In Latin
this relation is shown by affection, and the order of the words

represents their relative emphasis and importance in the writer's

or speaker’s mind.

3. The most emphatic place isrthe firm next in importance is
the last,· the weakest point is the middle.

4. As the most important word in the sentence is the subject,
and the second in importance is the verb, these normally stand first
and last respectively. Their respective modifiers stand next these

according to their relative emphasis. This may be represented
as follows: -

SUBJECT rottowro ΒΥ trs mortificas MOlelERS rottoweo ΒΥ VERE
