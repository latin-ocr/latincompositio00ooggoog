CATILINE IV

tv. Enoatsfl nummu vms

271. The proper translation ol the English auxiliary verbs may,
can, must, might, could, would, should presents many difficul
ties. These arise mainly from the lact thatin English these
verbs sometimes have their original and literal value, when they
must be rendered by independent verbs, and sometimes the lorce
ol potential auxiliaries which may be expressed by the Latin
subjunctive. The ambiguityol the English often leaves the inter-
pretation open to the individual judgment ol the translator. The
six lessons based on this oration will be devoted to a practical
consideration ol some ol the most important phases ol this subject.

LESSON LIX

maz ans

272. May and might are common auxiliaries in the translation
of some ol the subordinate subjunctive constructions* as, ior ex·
ample, in purpose clauses :—

Catilina remaincd that hc might hill the consul, catilina
ν minslt ut oonsulem interfioeret„

273. When may and might express mere possibility they are
translated by the Latin potential subjunctive:—

Vou may sooner find fortune than keep it, romonem sitim
repotiis quam retineis.
Vou might have seen themfigkting‚ videres eos pigneratis.

ἱ The beglnner ls apt to make the mistake oi supposing that a modal avxil-
lary must always be used in translatinga subiunctlm bnt see Part 1 sec. 77.
