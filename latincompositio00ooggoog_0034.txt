16 Lanu COMPOSITION

61. The most important uses of the imperfect are two :-

a. To express customary or continued action in past time.

b. To describe situations, fill in details and particulars3 while
the important forward steps in the narrative are denoted by the
perfect.

This difference between. the perfect and' the imperfect is well
illustrated by the latter half of Chapter 7, beginning caesar quod,
etc. The situation is described by the imperfects‚ tenebat, puti-
bat, existimabat. These are all preparatory to the first decisive
and important act on Caesar’s part, expressed by the words respondit
diem se ad deliberandum sumpturum.

62. rmous ann annasns

hoc proelio facto. after this battle was fought.
, pontem faciendum esurire. to see to building a bridge.
calamititis reminisci. to remember the alabaster.
