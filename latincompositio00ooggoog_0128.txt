431. The so·called special verbs that govem the dative take
this construction, not because of any arbitrary rule, but because
from the Latin point ol view they are intransitive and take ari
indirect object. The English meaning is not a saie guide, ior it
sometimes happens that two Latin verbs with the same English
equivalence will be the one transitive, governing the accusative,
and the other intransitive, governing the dative. For example, the
Latin has the two verbs nocere and laedere, both translated ta
injure,· but the formeris intransitive and the latter transitive.
