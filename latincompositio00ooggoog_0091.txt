2⁷1. Caesar says that the Aduatuci, 1who are descended
from the Cimbri and Teutones, had chosen for an abode a
place remarkably tortified by nature, since it had steep cliffs
on every side; and that they had fortified the gentle sloping
approach which was lett on one side, by a very high double
wall. Caesar,¹ as soon as he arrived, commanded his (men)
¹to hem in the city with a twelvefoot wall and to set up the
tower. When the enemy⁸ saw so big a machine being set
up at such a distance they laughed and said, with what
strength, pray‚ did men of such small stature hope to seta
tower of such weight on the wall?
